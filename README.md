This is an Android student project working with common UI elements such as -Button -TextView -Relative Layout -Linear Layout -A popup activity made by DisplayMetrics.
This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The result of each game will be shown in an activity that looks like a popup. In order to achieve the popup-looking activity, I had to get the width and height of the display and load it on a DisplayMetric.Also, I tried to learn to work with onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState to be able to keep the state of the game in case of the rotation of the device.
UI elements of the board are made of nine buttons arranged in three rows of linear layouts.The buttons have a width of zero and their tidy arrangement is handled by putting their layout_weight="1" (LinearLayout)
